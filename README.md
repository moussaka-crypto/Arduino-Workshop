# Arduino Workshops

### 12. Oct: Introduction to Arduino

1. **Blinker** - Learn how to control an LED to blink on and off at specified intervals.

2. **Traffic Light** - Simulate a simple traffic light system with red, yellow, and green LEDs.

3. **Intersection** - Extend the traffic light project to create a traffic light-controlled intersection with multiple traffic signals.

4. **LED Control with a button** - Control an LED using a button. Press the button to turn the LED on and off.

### 19. Oct: Sensors and Displays

1. **Temperature/Humidity Sensor** - Connect and read data from a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.

2. **OLED Output** - Display sensor data on a small OLED screen using the Adafruit SSD1306 library.

3. **Switching the OLED Output** - Two versions with a manual switch between temperature and humidity readings and another where the display automatically switches between the two readings at regular intervals.
